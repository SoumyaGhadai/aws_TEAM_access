Enabling IAM Identity Center - Temporary Elevated Access Management in AWS

Temporary Elevated Access Management (TEAM) in AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) allows you to provide just-in-time elevated access to AWS accounts and permissions. Here's a complete guide to setting this up for your personal project.
Prerequisites

    An AWS account with administrative privileges

    AWS IAM Identity Center already enabled in your account

    AWS Organizations set up (if managing multiple accounts)

Step-by-Step Setup
1. Enable IAM Identity Center (if not already enabled)

    Sign in to the AWS Management Console

    Navigate to the IAM Identity Center service

    If not already enabled, click "Enable AWS IAM Identity Center"

2. Configure Temporary Elevated Access Management

    In the IAM Identity Center console, go to the Settings page

    Scroll down to the Temporary elevated access management section

    Click Configure

3. Set Up TEAM Policies

    Define your elevated access policies:

        Click Create policy

        Specify:

            Policy name (e.g., "ProjectAdminAccess")

            Description

            Maximum elevation duration (1-24 hours)

            Permissions to grant during elevation

            Approval requirements (self-approval or require approval from others)

    Configure notification settings:

        Specify who should receive notifications for elevation requests

        Set up Amazon SNS topics if you want custom notifications

4. Assign TEAM Policies to Users/Groups

    Navigate to Users or Groups in IAM Identity Center

    Select the user or group you want to assign the TEAM policy to

    Click Assign access

    Choose the AWS accounts and permission sets that should be eligible for elevation

    Select the TEAM policy you created

5. Configure Just-in-Time Access Settings

    Go back to the TEAM configuration page

    Set default settings:

        Default elevation duration

        Maximum allowed elevation duration

        Cooling-off period between elevations

        Session recording preferences

6. Test the Configuration

    Log in as a test user through the IAM Identity Center portal

    Attempt to access a restricted resource

    Verify the elevation request flow works as expected

    Check that permissions are properly elevated and then revoked after the duration

Best Practices for Personal Projects

    Start with minimal permissions: Only elevate to what's absolutely needed

    Set short durations: 1-2 hours is usually sufficient for personal projects

    Enable logging: Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor elevation events

    Regularly review: Check your TEAM policies periodically to ensure they're still appropriate

Important Notes

    TEAM requires IAM Identity Center Premium edition (additional costs may apply)

    Changes may take a few minutes to propagate across AWS systems

    Ensure you understand the pricing implications before extensive use
